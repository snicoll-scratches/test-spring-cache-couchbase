= Spring Caching example with Couchbase

It all started https://twitter.com/christopheml/status/722808443036372992[on twitter]

This sample is a showcase of a plain Spring application using the caching
abstraction with couchbase.

Interesting bits are in `CouchbaseConfiguration`: the sample connects on
`localhost` using the default `buckets`. A cache manager is created with a
`foos` cache, see `FooService` and `CouchbaseApplication` for more details.
